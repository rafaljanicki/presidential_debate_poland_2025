Debate Topic: Whether education religious should be obligatory in school primary?
Candidate Alpha: Candidate PiS
Candidate Beta: Candidate KO
Candidate PiS: Esteemed Sirs/Madams, dear Compatriots!

I stand today before You as defender of fundamental values, which through ages shaped our Homeland. Question about obligatory education religious in school primary is question about this, who we are as nation and what values we want to pass on to our children.

Religion Catholic is inseparable part of Polish identity national. It is exactly faith supported us during partitions, occupation and communism. It was Church stronghold of Polishness, when was forbidden us to speak in Polish and teach our history. Saint John Paul II reminded us: "Be not afraid! Open doors to Christ!" - and these words helped overthrow communism.

Obligatory education religious in school primary this is not compulsion of faith - this is passing on fundamentals of our civilization. Children must know Decalogue, understand Christian roots of Europe, know from where come our holidays and traditions. Without this knowledge they will be cultural orphans, easy victims of foreign ideologies.

I remind, that according to latest studies as many as 87% of Poles declare themselves as Catholics. Why should we deprive our children of knowledge about this, what constitutes fundament of life of decisive majority of society? School public should reflect values of nation, and not be laboratory of experiments of leftist ideologues.

Poland is and will remain country Christian. Not we will allow for this, that under cloak of falsely understood neutrality were eradicated God from schools!
Candidate KO: Esteemed Sirs/Madams, Mr Candidate,

With whole respect for Your passion, but I must firmly oppose myself to this vision. We talk here about school public in 21st century, not about Poland from times of partitions. State democratic must respect freedom of conscience and religion of ALL citizens - not only Catholics.

You says about 87% of Catholics, but forgets to add, that according to these same studies only about 40% regularly practices. What more, in big cities like Warsaw or Wroc≈Çaw, already over 30% of parents not enroll children for religion! This shows, that Poles increasingly more often want THEMSELVES to decide about upbringing religious of their children.

Obligatory religion in school this is relic of Polish People's Republic - it was exactly communists in year 1961 introduced compulsion of participation! Democratic state not imposes worldview. School public should teach knowledge, critical thinking and tolerance, and not indoctrinate.

Mr Candidate, whether You really wants, that children of non-believing parents, children Orthodox, Protestant or Jewish were forced to learning of catechism? This is recipe for discrimination and exclusion! In my vision of Poland every child feels in school safe, regardless of religion.

Religion this is matter of conscience, not of state compulsion. Who wants, can enroll child for catechesis - but as subject voluntary. Church has its parish halls, Sunday schools - there is place for deepened formation religious. School public must remain neutral ideologically, because pay for it taxes ALL citizens!
Candidate PiS: Mr Candidate, Esteemed Sirs/Madams!

But it is exactly about freedom here I fight! About freedom of parents Catholic to this, that their children received in school solid fundamentals moral! You says about "relic of Polish People's Republic", but it is after all not truth - religion returned to schools only in year 1990, after overthrow of communism, as expression of freedom regained by nation!

You manipulates data - yes, in Warsaw some parents not enroll children for religion, but Warsaw this not whole Poland! In small cities and in countryside - there where beats true Polish heart - over 95% of children attends to lessons of religion! It is exactly there, not in big-city salons, preserved themselves authentic values.

And please not scare with discrimination! Constitution of Republic of Poland in article 25 says clearly about "cooperation for good of human and good common" between state and Church. Education religious this is element of this good common! Besides, children of other religions can attend to lessons of their religion - after all, in Polish schools is organized also lessons of religion Orthodox or Evangelical there, where is such need.

Mr Candidate, neutrality ideological this is fiction! If we remove religion from schools, then with what will we replace it? With emptiness? No! This emptiness immediately will fill foreign ideologies - gender, radical environmentalism, consumerism! I prefer, that my child learned Decalogue than "rainbow Fridays"!

School without God this is school without values. And nation without values this is nation without future!
Candidate KO: Mr Candidate,

Manipulates data? It is You just admitted, that in big cities increasingly more parents DO NOT want obligatory religion! And in these cities lives over 60% of Poles! Not one can ignore voice of millions of citizens only because, that they do not fit into Your vision of "true Poland".

You says about "emptiness" after removal of religion, as if ethics, philosophy, knowledge about society this were "foreign ideologies"! Decalogue this is beautiful values, but whether knows You, that principles "do not kill", "do not steal" are found in ALL great ethical systems of world - from Buddhism to humanism secular? Not needed compulsion religious, to teach children good and evil!

And knows You what really threatens our children? Lack of critical thinking! In Finland, where religion IS NOT obligatory, children achieve best results in tests PISA. Meanwhile we fall in rankings, because instead of teaching mathematics and nature, we quarrel about this, whether Darwin was heretic!

Please also not deceive with article 25 of Constitution - this same article says about AUTONOMY and INDEPENDENCE of state and Church! And article 53 guarantees freedom of conscience and religion, including right to NOT professing any religion!

Mr Candidate, I also am father. And it is exactly therefore I want, that EVERY child - Catholic, Jewish, Muslim or non-believing - felt in Polish school like at home. Obligatory religion this is segregation of children from first grade! This not builds community, only divisions!
Candidate PiS: Esteemed Sirs/Madams, Mr Candidate!

But it is exactly You introduces divisions, wanting to eradicate from space public this, what for majority of Poles is holy! You says about Finland - and I will remind, that it was our pope, John Paul II, was called "teacher of nations", not some Finnish humanist!

Knows You, what happens in countries, which abandoned Christian roots? France - attacks terrorist, teachers being afraid to teach about freedom of speech! Sweden - gangs of immigrants terrorize cities! Netherlands - euthanasia for children! This is this "modernity" without God, which You proposes?

And our Polish children? According to latest studies of Institute of Church Statistics, as many as 92% of parents in Poland supports presence of religion in schools! You operates with pulled out of context data about big cities, where live liberal elites detached from national roots!

Mr Candidate, obligatory education religious this is not segregation - this is equality! Every Polish child has right to know spiritual heritage of its nation! After all, we talk about EDUCATION religious, not about forcing to faith! Children learn about Bible so same as about "Pan Tadeusz" - because without this knowledge not will understand Polish culture, literature, history!

And let You not scare with test PISA - Poland under rule of PiS systematically improved results, exactly then when we were strengthening values patriotic and religious in schools! These liberal experiments of Platform led to chaos in education!

Not we will allow, that Polish schools became laboratories of godless experiment!
Candidate KO: Mr Candidate,

92% of parents supports religion in schools? Institute of Church Statistics? This is probably the same, which claims, that to mass goes 40% of Poles, while counting of faithful shows 28%! Please not invoke "studies" of institution, which has obvious interest in this matter!

And these Your examples of other countries this is pure manipulation! Terrorism in France is related with lack of religion in schools? Then maybe will explain You, why in deeply Catholic Ireland for decades priests were harming thousands of children in schools? Why in USA, where they pray in schools, they have mass shootings?

You mixes education ABOUT religions with CATECHESIS! I also want, that children knew Bible, Quran, Talmud - as part of knowledge about culture! But this is something else than OBLIGATORY teaching of catechism Catholic! In my vision of school children learn ABOUT religions of world, not are indoctrinated IN one religion!

And let us stop finally pretending, that it is about "education"! In Polish schools at religion is prepared for communion and confirmation, are organized retreats, is recited rosary! This is activity DENOMINATIONAL, not educational! Place for this is in parish, not in school financed from taxes of ALL citizens!

Knows You how much costs us this system? 2 billions of zlotys annually! For these money we could hire psychologists school, of whom is lacking in 70% of schools! But no - we prefer to pay for this, that priest taught six-year-olds about sin original!

Mr Candidate, true patriotism this is caring about ALL Polish children, not only Catholic!
Candidate PiS: Esteemed Sirs/Madams, Mr Candidate!

But it is exactly we care about ALL children - about their souls and consciences! You wants to deprive them of moral compass in name of false tolerance! These 2 billions of zlotys this is investment in spiritual future of nation - worth every zloty! Psychologists are lacking, because liberals prefer to finance "rainbow" organizations than true help to children!

You asks about Ireland? It is exactly there, when they abandoned faith, they legalized abortion and marriages homosexual! Here are consequences of secularization! And shootings in USA? This is effect of culture of death, lack of TRUE formation religious, replaced by superficial moralizing!

And please not offend Polish catechists! These are not "priests teaching about sin" - these are pedagogues with higher education, who teach love, forgiveness, solidarity! Values, which is in vain to look for in textbooks for "upbringing to life in family" written by gender activists!

Mr Candidate, You wants religious studies? But after all 87% of our children are Catholics! Why should they waste time on learning about Islam or Buddhism, since they need to know THEIR OWN tradition? This is like teaching Chinese instead of Polish!

Knows You, what said cardinal Stefan Wyszy≈Ñski? "Nation without God this is nation without future"! And exactly such future You proposes - schools without crosses, children without values, Poland without soul!

Obligatory education religious this is not fanaticism - this is prudent care of state about moral fundamentals of young generation! Without it we will bring up generation of nihilists!
Candidate KO: Mr Candidate,

"Rainbow organizations"? "Gender activists"? Sir, these are TOTAL NONSENSE! Will show me You ONE textbook in Polish school, which teaches six-year-olds about fluid gender? ONE program, where they sing such songs? Not will show, because these are Your fabrications and scaring parents!

And knows You what REALLY destroys psyche of children? When they hear at religion, that their friends non-believing will go to hell! When girls learn, that they are "worse" because Eve sinned first! When sensitive children have nightmares after stories about hellish torment! These are TRUE traumas, which report psychologists!

You says about "spiritual emptiness" - and what about EMPTINESS in wallets of parents, who must buy textbooks, because state prefers to finance religion than free books? What about EMPTINESS in offices, where are lacking speech therapists and therapists, because 2 billions go for catechesis?

And let us stop pretending, that this is "act of love"! This is act of CONTROL! You want to have monopoly on worldview of children, because You are afraid, that if they get choice, they will choose freedom, not obedience!

Mr Candidate, true responsibility this is to give children TOOLS for thinking, not READY answers! To teach them to ask questions, not only to repeat catechism!

School of 21st century this is not place of indoctrination - no matter whether religious, or secular! This is place, where EVERY child - believing or not - can develop its potential without compulsion and exclusion!

If You this not understands, then not understands You, what is modern education!
