Candidate PiS: Ladies and Gentlemen, dear Compatriots!

Today we stand before a fundamental choice concerning the security of our Homeland. The question is: should Poland remain a sovereign state with its own strong national army, or hand over control of our soldiers to Brussels bureaucrats?

My answer is unequivocal: Poland must develop its own independent national army! This is a matter of our sovereignty, security, and national dignity.

Please look at the facts. Under the rule of Law and Justice, we began the largest modernization of the Polish Army since 1989. We increased the size of the army, purchased modern equipment - Abrams and K2 tanks, F-35 planes, Patriot and HIMARS systems. We aim for a 300,000-strong army, because as Marshal Piłsudski said: "To be defeated and not to yield - that is victory."

Meanwhile, what does Brussels propose to us? An illusory "European army" in which Polish soldiers would be subordinate to foreign commands, fighting for foreign interests, perhaps even in conflicts contrary to Polish national interest. Do we really want the fate of our sons to be decided in Berlin or Paris?

NATO - yes! An alliance of equal, sovereign states. European army - no! This is a path to losing independence, which our ancestors paid for with blood.

Let us remember: only a strong, national army is a guarantee that history will not repeat itself. That no one will ever dare to raise a hand against Poland again!

Candidate KO: Ladies and Gentlemen, Mr. Candidate,

With all due respect, you are presenting a false alternative. No one is proposing to hand over Polish soldiers to "foreign command" or to liquidate the Polish Army! This is scaring Poles, which serves only a political game.

The facts are: Civic Coalition consistently advocates for a strong, national Polish army operating within NATO. We are continuing the modernization of the army - we have just signed agreements for further air defense systems for 3 billion dollars. We are increasing defense spending to 5% of GDP - more than ever in history!

But at the same time, we see that in the face of the threat from Russia, Europe must cooperate more closely. It is not about replacing national armies, but about better coordination, joint arms purchases, which are cheaper, and the development of the European defense industry. Today, 60% of our armaments are bought in the USA - is that independence?

Mr. Candidate, under your governments, the Polish army was underfunded for years! Only Russia's aggression against Ukraine woke you up. And now you are scaring Poles with a "European army" that does not exist and is not planned.

True security is a strong Polish Army, strong NATO, and strong European cooperation. Because together we are stronger. A lonely Poland - that is a defenseless Poland, which we painfully learned in 1939.

---------------

Candidate PiS: Mr. Candidate, you are misleading Poles!

You say that no one is planning a European army? What about the European Parliament resolution from November 2023, which directly calls for the creation of "permanent EU armed forces"? What about Mr. Macron's statements about "European defense sovereignty"? These are not pipe dreams - these are real plans for the federalization of Europe at the expense of our independence!

You claim that under our governments the army was underfunded? That's a lie! We were the first to exceed 2% of GDP for defense as early as 2018. We started the technical modernization program, we created the Territorial Defense Forces - 35,000 soldiers who were not there before! And Mr. Donald Tusk as prime minister liquidated military units and sold barracks to developers.

You ask about independence, buying weapons in the USA? Well, that's the point - we choose the best allies and the best equipment! Americans are our proven partners who have never failed us. And what does the "European defense industry" propose? French Leclerc tanks, half of which are inoperable? German Puma infantry fighting vehicles, which break down during exercises?

And most importantly - you invoke the year 1939. That is precisely why we cannot repeat the mistakes! Back then, we also counted on allies from the West. Where were the French and British in September? That is why today we must have our own strong army that will defend every inch of Polish land itself!

We will not allow ourselves to be drawn into another experiment of disarming Poland under the slogans of "common Europe"!

---------------

Candidate KO: Mr. Candidate, you are manipulating facts and scaring Poles!

Firstly - a PE resolution is not law! It is an opinion that has no binding force. No EU country plans to liquidate its armies. France, Germany, everyone is expanding their armed forces. Cooperation does not mean subordination!

Secondly - you are lying about our governments! It was Donald Tusk as prime minister who increased the number of professional soldiers from 70 to 100 thousand. And your WOT? These are often poorly trained volunteers with outdated equipment, more a propaganda formation than a real combat force. Real soldiers call them "weekend warriors."

As for equipment - of course, we buy from the USA, because they are our key ally. But do you know that the German concern Rheinmetall is currently building an ammunition factory in Poland for 500 million euros? That together with South Korea we are developing the production of K2 tanks IN POLAND? This is building independence - production here, jobs for Poles!

And do you know what? It was your party that blocked EU funds for army modernization for 8 years! Because of your conflict with Brussels, we lost billions of euros from the European Defense Fund. Billions that could have gone to Polish barracks, Polish equipment, Polish soldiers!

Let's not scare each other with the year 1939. Today we have NATO, we have Article 5, we have American bases in Poland. But we must also build European solidarity, because Putin is not sleeping. And a lonely Poland - even with 300,000 soldiers - will not defend itself against Russia. Together with allies - yes!

---------------

Candidate PiS: Mr. Candidate, do you really believe what you are saying?

You claim that the PE resolution is "just an opinion"? The same was said about the euro - "it's just a proposal." Today half of Europe does not have its own currency! The same was true with the migration pact - "non-binding recommendations," and today we are threatened with penalties for not accepting immigrants. The European Union is a project of gradually taking away powers from states - whoever does not see this is blind or naive!

You are attacking the Territorial Defense Forces? That's a disgrace! WOT is 38,000 patriots who defended the border against Lukashenka's hybrid attack, helped during floods, during the pandemic. "Weekend warriors"? Tell that to the WOT soldiers who risked their lives on the border!

And do you know exactly how much Polish component is in these K2 tanks? Only 40% at best! The rest is imported. On the other hand, we negotiated true Polonization - ultimately 80% of production in Poland. But your government torpedoed it, because it preferred to please Berlin!

And most importantly - you talk about the European Defense Fund. But you won't tell people the truth - that accepting this money would mean agreeing to joint arms purchases controlled by Brussels! That we would have to ask for permission what to buy for the Polish army! We chose sovereignty instead of euro-alms.

NATO - yes, because it is an alliance of sovereign states. Fort Trump in Poznań - yes, because it is a real guarantee of security. But handing over control of the Polish army to Germans and French, who just a year ago wanted "not to humiliate Putin"? Never!

---------------

Candidate KO: Mr. Candidate, you are mixing facts with propaganda and scaring Poles!

38,000 WOT soldiers? Where did you get that number? Official MON data speaks of a maximum of 35,000, of which only a part is fully trained. Of course, I respect their service, but you cannot build defense on enthusiasm alone!

And now about the lies - you claim that the European Defense Fund means "asking Brussels for permission." That is completely untrue! EDF is co-financing OUR projects - we decide what to develop, and the EU adds money. A Polish arms company can get 100% co-financing for the development of new technologies! You, out of foolish pride, rejected billions of zlotys for our defense industry.

Fort Trump in Poznań? Mr. Candidate, there is no such thing! There is an increased rotational presence of US troops, which WE negotiated under the PO-PSL government. We signed the first anti-missile shield agreement in Redzikowo. You only continued our work, taking credit for yourselves!

And do you know what? You talk about Germans and French who "did not want to humiliate Putin." And who blocked EU sanctions on Russian coal for 8 years? PiS! Who defended the interests of Orlen trading with Russians? Who issued visas for bribes to people from Asia and Africa, while you scared us with "Islamic terrorists"?

A strong Poland is Poland in a strong Europe. Because when Putin attacked Ukraine, it was not "sovereign" Belarus that stood against him, but a united Europe and NATO. And that is our strength - alliances, cooperation, joint arms production. Not a lonely island that is easy to conquer!

---------------

Candidate PiS: Mr. Candidate, do you really believe what you are saying?

You are lying about Baltic Pipe - in 2010 it was just paper, a dream! Implementation only started under our governments. We put the gas terminal in Świnoujście into operation, we expanded it twice. And you? You signed long-term contracts with Gazprom!

150 billion euros lost? Where did you get that fantastic number? That's more than the entire Polish budget! The truth is - in 2020 we negotiated the largest EU budget for Poland in history - 770 billion zlotys! And that Brussels tried to blackmail us, breaking treaties? That's their problem, not ours!

Deputy Minister Wawrzyk was immediately dismissed as soon as suspicions arose. And do you know how many of your ministers are in prison for corruption? Where are the tapes from the Sowa i Przyjaciele restaurant? Where are the millions from the gambling scandal? We hold our own accountable, you - covered up thieves!

And most importantly - you talk about NATO. Of course, we are for NATO! But NATO is an alliance of SOVEREIGN states, not a European super-state! Americans, British - they respect our independence. And Germans? French? They want to drag us into their project of a federal Europe, where Poland will be a province!

Mr. Candidate, the difference between us is simple: we believe in a strong, independent Poland cooperating with allies. You believe in Poland as part of a European super-state. We say: Polish army under Polish command! You say: let's give up part of our sovereignty for EU money.

The choice belongs to Poles. Do they want to be masters in their own country, or mercenaries in someone else's army!

---------------

Candidate KO: Mr. Candidate, these are the last lies in this debate!

770 billion zlotys from the EU? Yes, which YOU BLOCKED because of your wars with Brussels! To this day, we have not used 60 billion from the National Recovery Plan because of your stupidity! This money was waiting for Polish hospitals, the Polish army, and you preferred ideological wars!

You say "immediately dismissed"? Wawrzyk was dismissed only when the media revealed the scandal! For months he traded visas! And Sasin, who wasted 70 million on elections that did not take place? Still a minister! Kamiński and Wąsik convicted of abuses? Pardoned and promoted!

But let's go back to the army - because that's what we're talking about. Mr. Candidate, NO ONE is proposing to hand over the Polish army to foreign command! That's your fear propaganda! European cooperation means:

Joint ammunition purchases - cheaper and more

Joint equipment production - jobs in Poland

Joint exercises - better coordination

Do you know what? When the Russians attacked Ukraine, it was not the "sovereign" Belarusian army that stopped them. It was NATO and the EU together that supported Ukraine - with weapons, money, sanctions. Because TOGETHER we are stronger!

Dear Compatriots - the choice is simple. Either Poland strong in alliances, with a 300,000-strong army cooperating with the best armies in the world. Or Poland alone, at odds with its neighbors, dreaming of a power it will not achieve in isolation.

We choose a strong Poland, because it is wise. A Poland that knows that in unity there is strength. A Poland whose soldiers are respected from Washington to Warsaw!

Don't let yourselves be intimidated! Vote for a safe Poland in a safe Europe!

---------------

Candidate PiS: Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Compatriots!

The candidate ends his speech with slogans, but Poles deserve the truth!

60 billion from the KPO? Yes, money for which Brussels demanded the subordination of Polish courts! Money for which we were supposed to agree to the migration pact and accept illegal immigrants! We said: Polish sovereignty is priceless! We will not sell independence for EU silver!

You talk about Sasin? 70 million spent on protecting Poles from the pandemic is nothing compared to the billions you squandered on privatization and selling off national assets! Amber Gold, the tape scandal, GetBack - that's your legacy!

But most importantly - you still haven't answered the fundamental question: who will command Polish soldiers in this imagined "European cooperation"? Who will decide where and for what they will fight? Because we know - they will decide in Berlin and Paris, and Polish soldiers will carry out orders!

Dear Compatriots! Remember - only its own strong army defended Poland in 1920. Only its own army can defend us today. NATO - yes, because it is an alliance of free nations. Fort Trump - yes, because Americans are the guarantors of our security. But never, ever will we hand over Polish soldiers to foreign command!

Choose wisely! Choose a sovereign Poland, with an army of 300,000 brave soldiers under POLISH command! Choose a Poland that tells the world: we are ready to defend ourselves, but we will gladly accept help from true friends!

Poland strong! Poland independent! Poland victorious!

God bless!

---------------

Candidate KO: Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Compatriots!

You have just heard a festival of fear and lies. The candidate still does not understand that the 21st century is not the 19th! That Poland's strength is not a lonely island, but wise alliances!

He talks about 1920? That's when French officers advised our army! It was French weapons and instructors that helped us stop the Bolsheviks! History teaches - Poland wins when it has allies!

60 billion from the KPO is money for Polish hospitals, where people are dying in queues! For Polish schools, where there is a shortage of teachers! For the Polish army, which lacks barracks! And you, out of pride and arrogance, said "no"! That's not patriotism - that's stupidity!

And for the last time, I explain - NO ONE wants to take away command of the Polish army! Cooperation is not subordination! When Polish soldiers train with Americans within NATO - do they lose sovereignty? No! They learn and become stronger!

Dear Compatriots! Don't be fooled!

They scare you with Germans and French - our allies, who have taken in millions of Ukrainians and support us against Russia!

They reject billions of euros - your money! - because they prefer conflict to cooperation!

They isolate Poland, because a lonely Poland is easier to rule with fear!

We offer a Poland strong with a 300,000-strong army cooperating with the best armies in the world! A Poland that uses every opportunity for development! A Poland in the center of Europe, not on its margins!

Vote for a wise and strong Poland! For the Poland of our children - safe, modern, respected!

Together we can do more!

---------------

Candidate PiS: Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Compatriots!

The candidate ends his speech with the European Union flag next to the Polish one. This is symbolic - for them, Brussels is as important as Warsaw!

You invoke the year 1920? Yes, French advisors helped, but it was POLISH soldiers under the command of POLISH Marshal Piłsudski who won! And where were the French in 1939? They sat behind the Maginot Line while the Wehrmacht destroyed Warsaw!

You talk about a "festival of fear"? It is you who scare Poles with Putin to push us into the arms of Berlin! We tell the truth - a strong Poland is Poland with its own army, not a province of a European empire!

These "billions from the KPO" of yours - read the fine print! It states: acceptance of illegal immigrants, homosexual marriages, gender ideology in schools! We said NO, because Poland is not a country for sale!

Dear Compatriots! They are deceiving you! They say "cooperation," but they plan subordination. They say "development," but they want to sell off our sovereignty. They say "modernity," but they want to destroy our tradition!

Remember:

Only PiS built an army of 300,000 soldiers!

Only PiS brought American troops to Poland!

Only PiS tells the truth about the threats!

Don't be misled by the mirages of "European solidarity"! Choose proven, Polish, patriotic solutions!

Poland is one! Poland is ours! Poland is sovereign!

Long live Poland! Long live the independent Polish Army!

God, Honor, Homeland!

---------------

Candidate KO: Ladies and Gentlemen! Dear Compatriots!

Here is the true face of PiS - they scare you with "gender ideology" and "homosexual marriages," which are not in the KPO at all! This is a lie that can be easily verified! The EU documents do not contain a single word about forced acceptance of immigrants for this money!

The candidate ends with the slogan "God, Honor, Homeland" - beautiful words that they desecrated for 8 years! Where was honor when they stole on visas? Where was the homeland when they siphoned public money to shell companies? Where was God when priests from the pulpit ordered who to vote for?

But let's go back to the army - because that's what we're talking about:

300,000 soldiers? Most are just plans on paper!

American troops? Negotiated since 2014 by our government!

Truth about threats? It was you who divided Poles for 8 years!

Dear Compatriots! You are not choosing between Poland and Europe - that is a false alternative! You are choosing between:

A wise Poland that uses every opportunity - and a foolish Poland that rejects billions out of pride!

A Poland strong in alliances - and a lonely Poland, easy to defeat!

A Poland that unites - and a Poland that divides its citizens!

We love Poland no less than they do. But our love is wise, not blind. It builds, not destroys. It unites, not divides.

Vote for the Poland you deserve! Strong, wise, European, and proudly independent!

Poland for all Poles!

Together we can do more!
