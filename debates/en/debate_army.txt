Debate Topic: Whether Poland should develop own independent army national, or strive to integration within framework of joint European army?
Candidate Alpha: Candidate PiS
Candidate Beta: Candidate KO
Candidate PiS: Esteemed Sirs/Madams, dear Compatriots!

We stand today before fundamental choice concerning security of our Homeland. Question sounds: whether Poland should remain sovereign state with own, strong army national, or also give away control over our soldiers into hands Brussels' bureaucrats?

My answer is unambiguous: Poland must develop own, independent army national! This matter our sovereignty, security and dignity national.

Please look at facts. Under rule of Law and Justice we started biggest modernization of Military Polish from year 1989. We increased numbers of army, we bought modern equipment - tanks Abrams and K2, airplanes F-35, systems Patriot and HIMARS. We strive to 300-thousand army, because as spoke marshal Piłsudski: "To be defeated and not yield - this is victory".

Meanwhile what proposes us Brussels? Illusory "army European", in which Polish soldiers would be subordinated foreign commands, would fight for foreign interests, perhaps even in conflicts contrary with Polish reason of state. Whether really we want, that about fate of our sons would decide in Berlin or Paris?

NATO - yes! Alliance of equal, sovereign states. Army European - no! This is road to loss of independence, which our ancestors paid for with blood.

Let us remember: only strong, national army is guarantor, that history itself will not repeat. That nobody already never will dare itself to raise hand on Poland!
Candidate KO: Esteemed Sirs/Madams, Mr Candidate,

With whole respect, but presents You false alternative. Nobody not proposes handing over Polish soldiers under "foreign command" or liquidation of Military Polish! This is scaring Poles, which serves only political game.

Facts are such: Coalition Civic consistently speaks itself for strong, national army of Poland operating in framework of NATO. It is we continue modernization of military - just we signed agreements for further systems of defense air for 3 billions of dollars. We increase expenditures for defense to 5% GDP - more than ever in history!

But at same time we see, that in face of threat from side of Russia, Europe must more closely cooperate. Not goes about replacement of armies national, but about better coordination, joint purchases of armament, which are cheaper, and development of European industry defense. Today 60% of our armament we buy in USA - whether this is independence?

Mr Candidate, under your rule Polish army was underfunded for years! Only aggression of Russia on Ukraine you woke up. And now scares You Poles with "army European", which not exists and not is planned.

True security this is strong Military Polish, strong NATO and strong cooperation European. Because together we are stronger. Lone Poland - this is Poland defenseless, about what painfully we convinced ourselves in year 1939.
Candidate PiS: Mr Candidate, this is You introduces Poles into error!

Says You, that nobody not plans army European? And what with resolution of Parliament European from November of year 2023, which directly calls to creation of "permanent forces armed of EU"? What with statements of Mr Macron about "European sovereignty defense"? These not are pipe dreams - these are real plans of federalization of Europe at cost of our independence!

Claims You, that under our rule army was underfunded? This is lie! It was we first exceeded 2% GDP for defense already in year 2018. It was we started program of modernization technical, we created Forces of Defense Territorial - 35 thousands of soldiers, whom earlier not were! And Mr Donald Tusk as prime minister was liquidating units military and was selling off barracks to developers.

Asks You about independence, buying weapon in USA? Well exactly about this goes - we choose best allies and best equipment! Americans these are our proven partners, who never us not failed. And what proposes "European industry defense"? French tanks Leclerc, which in half are faulty? German vehicles combat Puma, which break itself at exercises?

And most important - evokes You year 1939. It is exactly therefore not we can repeat errors! Then also we counted on allies from West. Where were French and British in September? Therefore today we must have own, strong army, which itself will defend every span of Polish land!

Not we will give ourselves to be drawn into another experiment of disarming of Poland under slogans of "common Europe"!
Candidate KO: Mr Candidate, mixes You facts with propaganda and scares Poles!

After first - resolution of EP this not is law! This is opinion, which not has force binding. No state of EU not plans liquidation of its armies. France, Germany, all build up their forces armed. Cooperation not means subordination!

After second - lies You about our rule! It was Donald Tusk as prime minister increased number of soldiers professional from 70 to 100 thousands. And Your WOT? These are often badly trained volunteers with outdated equipment, more formation propaganda than real force combat. Real soldiers say about them "weekend warriors".

What to equipment - of course, that we buy from USA, because they are our key ally. But whether knows You, that German concern Rheinmetall builds exactly in Poland factory of ammunition for 500 millions of euro? That jointly with Korea South we develop production of tanks K2 IN POLAND? This is building of independence - production at us, places of work for Poles!

And knows You what? Exactly Your party for 8 years was blocking union funds for modernization of army! Through Your conflict with Brussels we lost billions of euro from European Fund Defense. Billions, which could go for Polish barracks, Polish equipment, Polish soldiers!

Not let us scare ourselves mutually with year 1939. Today we have NATO, we have art. 5, we have American bases in Poland. But we must also build European solidarity, because Putin not sleeps. And lone Poland - even with 300 thousands of soldiers - not will defend itself against Russia. Together with allies - yes!
Candidate PiS: Mr Candidate, You really believes in this, what You says?

Claims You, that resolution of EP this is "only opinion"? So same was said about euro - "this is only proposal". Today half of Europe not has own currency! So same was with pact migration - "non-binding recommendations", and today threaten us penalties for not accepting immigrants. Union European this is project of gradual taking away of competences to states - who this not sees, is blind or naive!

Attacks You Forces of Defense Territorial? This is disgrace! WOT this is 38 thousands of patriots, who defended border against attack hybrid of Łukaszenka, helped during flood, during pandemic. "Weekend warriors"? Let You this say in face to soldiers of WOT, who risked life at border!

And knows You, how much exactly Polish component is in these tanks K2? Merely 40% in best case! Rest this is import. For this we negotiated true polonization - ultimately 80% of production in Poland. But Your government this torpedoed, because preferred to make itself likeable to Berlin!

And most important - says You about European Fund Defense. But not will say You to people truth - that acceptance of these money would mean consent for joint purchases of armament controlled by Brussels! That we would have to ask about consent, what buy for Polish army! We chose sovereignty instead of euro-alms.

NATO - yes, because this is alliance of sovereign states. Fort Trump in Poznań - yes, because this is real guarantee of security. But giving away of control over Polish army to Germans and to French, who yet year ago wanted "not to humiliate Putin"? Never!
Candidate KO: Mr Candidate, mixes You facts with propaganda and scares Poles!

After first - resolution of EP this not is law! This is opinion, which not has force binding. No state of EU not plans liquidation of its armies. France, Germany, all build up their forces armed. Cooperation not means subordination!

Candidate PiS: Mr Candidate, Your desperation until hits after eyes!

Lies You about Baltic Pipe - in year 2010 this was only paper, dream! Realization started only under our rule. Gasport in Świnoujście we handed over to use, we expanded it twice. And you? You were signing long-term contracts with Gazprom!

150 billions of euro lost? From where You got this phantasmagorical number? This is more than whole budget of Poland! Truth is such - we negotiated in year 2020 biggest budget of EU for Poland in history - 770 billions of zlotys! And that Brussels was trying us to blackmail, breaking treaties? This is their problem, not our!

Vice-minister Wawrzyk was immediately dismissed, when only appeared itself suspicions. And knows You how many of your ministers sits for corruption? Where are tapes from restaurant Owl and Friends? Where are millions from affair gambling? We hold accountable our own, you - You were covering thieves!

And most important - says You about NATO. Of course, that we are for NATO! But NATO this is alliance of SOVEREIGN states, not European super-state! Americans, British - they respect our independence. And Germans? French? They want us to draw in into their own project of federal Europe, where Poland will be province!

Mr Candidate, difference between us is simple: we believe in strong, independent Poland cooperating with allies. You believe in Poland as part of European super-state. We say: Polish army under Polish command! You say: let us give away part of sovereignty for union money.

Choice belongs to Poles. Whether they want to be hosts in own country, or mercenaries in foreign army!
Candidate KO: Mr Candidate, this is already last lies in this debate!

770 billions of zlotys from EU? Yes, which YOU BLOCKED through your wars with Brussels! To today not we used 60 billions from National Plan of Recovery through your stupidity! These money were waiting for Polish hospitals, Polish army, and you preferred ideological wars!

Says You "immediately dismissed"? Wawrzyk was recalled only when media revealed affair! For months was trading with visas! And Sasin, who wasted 70 millions on elections, which itself not happened? Still minister! Kamiński and Wąsik convicted for abuses? Pardoned and promoted!

But let us return to army - because about this we talk. Mr Candidate, NOBODY not proposes handing over of Polish army under foreign command! This is your propaganda of fear! Cooperation European this is:

Joint purchases of ammunition - cheaper and more

Joint production of equipment - places of work in Poland

Joint exercises - better coordination

Knows You what? When Russians were attacking Ukraine, it was not "sovereign" army Belarusian them stopped. It was NATO and EU together supported Ukraine - with weapon, with money, with sanctions. Because TOGETHER we are stronger!

Dear Compatriots - choice is simple. Either Poland strong in alliances, with 300-thousand army cooperating with best armies of world. Or Poland lone, at odds with neighbors, dreaming about power/might, which not will achieve in isolation.

We choose Poland strong, because wise. Poland, which knows, that in unity is strength. Poland, whose soldiers are respected from Washington to Warsaw!

Not give yourselves to be intimidated! Vote for safe Poland in safe Europe!
Candidate PiS: Esteemed Sirs/Madams! Dear Compatriots!

Mr candidate ends his own speech with slogans, but Poles deserve on truth!

60 billions from KPO? Yes, money, for which Brussels was demanding subordination of Polish courts! Money, for which we were supposed to agree itself on pact migration and acceptance of illegal immigrants! We said: Polish sovereignty is priceless! Not we will sell independence for union silver pieces!

Says You about Sasin? 70 millions spent on protection of Poles against pandemic this is nothing compared to billions, which you were squandering on privatization and sell-off of property national! Amber Gold, affair tape, GetBack - this is your legacy!

But most important - You still not answered to fundamental question: who will be commanding with Polish soldiers in this invented "European cooperation"? Who will decide, where and for what they will be fighting? Because we know - to decide they will be in Berlin and Paris, and Polish soldiers will be executing orders!

Dear Compatriots! Remember - only own, strong army defended Poland in year 1920. Only own army can defend us today. NATO - yes, because this is alliance of free nations. Fort Trump - yes, because Americans are guarantors of our security. But never, never ever not we will give away Polish soldiers under foreign command!

Choose wisely! Choose Poland sovereign, with army of 300 thousands of brave soldiers under POLISH command! Choose Poland, which says to world: we are ready to defend ourselves alone, but gladly we will accept help of true friends!

Poland strong! Poland independent! Poland victorious!

Bless God!
Candidate KO: Esteemed Sirs/Madams! Dear Compatriots!

You listened to just festival of fear and lies. Mr candidate still not understands, that 21st century this is not 19th! That strength of Poland this is not lone island, but wise alliances!

Says about year 1920? It was exactly then French officers were advising our army! It was French weapon and instructors helped us stop Bolsheviks! History teaches - Poland wins, when has allies!

60 billions from KPO this is money for Polish hospitals, where die people in queues! For Polish schools, where is lacking teachers! For Polish army, which is lacking barracks! And you from pride and arrogance you said "no"! This is not patriotism - this is stupidity!

And last time I explain - NOBODY not wants to take away of command over Polish army! Cooperation this is not subordination! When Polish soldiers train with American in framework of NATO - whether lose sovereignty? No! Learn themselves and become stronger!

Dear Compatriots! Not give yourselves to be cheated!

They scare you with Germans and with French - with our allies, who accepted millions of Ukrainians and support us against Russia!

They reject billions of euro - your money! - because prefer conflict than cooperation!

They isolate Poland, because with lone Poland easier to rule with fear!

We offer Poland strong with 300-thousand army cooperating with best ones! Poland, which uses every opportunity for development! Poland in center of Europe, not on its margin!

Vote for Poland wise and strong! For Poland of our children - safe, modern, respected!

Poland for all Poles! 🇵🇱

Together we can more!
