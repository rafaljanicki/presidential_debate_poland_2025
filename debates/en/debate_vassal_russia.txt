Candidate PiS: Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Compatriots!

I stand before you today as a son of a nation that has fought for independence for centuries. The question posed in this debate is not only absurd – it is offensive to the memory of millions of Poles who gave their lives for a free Homeland!

Russia under Putin is an aggressor who brutally attacked our neighbor – Ukraine. It is an imperialist state that has never come to terms with the collapse of its empire. Let us remember Katyn, let us remember September 17, 1939, let us remember decades of enslavement under the Soviet yoke!

Poland is a proud, sovereign member of NATO and the European Union. Our army, which under the rule of Law and Justice we expanded to 185,000 soldiers, with a plan to reach 300,000, is the guarantor of our security. We spend a record 4% of GDP on defense – more than any other NATO country!

Who even dares to ask such a question? Is this a provocation by Russian agents of influence? Poland will never again be anyone's vassal! As Saint John Paul II used to say: "Be not afraid!" – but I add: let us not be afraid, because we are strong, sovereign, and have powerful allies in the West!

God bless!

Candidate KO: Ladies and Gentlemen, Dear Voters!

Mr. Kowalski begins this debate with emotion and pathos, but I prefer to talk about facts. Of course, Poland should not give up its sovereignty to anyone – neither Russia, nor any other state. This is obvious and we agree on this matter completely.

But please note how the PiS candidate immediately resorts to rhetoric of fear and division. He suggests that anyone in Poland wants to give up our independence – that's manipulation! For 8 years of your governments, it was you who isolated Poland in Europe, argued with allies, blocked EU funds with your attacks on the rule of law.

You talk about 185,000 soldiers? That's not true – according to official MON data, at the end of 2023, the Polish Army numbered approximately 164,000 professional soldiers and WOT soldiers combined. Let's not mislead voters!

The true security of Poland rests on three pillars: a strong army – here we agree, but also on alliances within NATO and the EU, and on wisely conducted diplomacy. For years, you destroyed our international position. We are rebuilding it.

Poland is and will be sovereign, but sovereignty in the 21st century means the ability to build coalitions and cooperate, not isolation. It is we, Civic Coalition, who unblocked 60 billion euros from the KPO for Poland – money that you lost due to your arrogance and violation of the rule of law!

---------------

Candidate PiS: Mr. Kowalski, you are misleading Poles!

You talk about 164,000 soldiers? But please - that's data from before our great reform! The Homeland Defense Act of 2022 began an unprecedented expansion of the army. To that, you must add the Territorial Defense Forces, which we created from scratch - over 35,000 territorials! Together, that gives us this powerful force.

And as for EU funds - that's a lie! We didn't "lose" them - Brussels illegally blackmailed Poland! The conditionality mechanism is an illegal tool for forcing a sovereign state to change its internal legal system. We defended the Polish Constitution!

You talk about diplomacy? Your "diplomacy" is capitulation! Donald Tusk went to Berlin in his first week in office to pay homage! And us? We built the Three Seas Initiative, strengthened the alliance with the USA - it was under our governments that Camp Kościuszko with American soldiers was established!

Do you know what the real threat is? Your Migration Pact! You agreed to the forced acceptance of illegal immigrants - 30,000 annually according to some estimates! It is you who are selling Polish sovereignty for EU silver!

Poland needs a strong government that says "NO" to dictates from outside - whether from Moscow or Brussels!

---------------

Candidate KO: Mr. Nowak, you are again manipulating facts and scaring Poles!

Firstly - the Territorial Defense Forces are part of the Polish Army, they cannot be counted separately! That's like counting the same zloty twice. Official MON data is clear - the total number of soldiers of all formations is approximately 164,000.

Secondly - "illegal blackmail from Brussels"? Poland signed European treaties, committing to uphold the rule of law! You broke these rules, destroying the independence of the courts, and now you cry that there are consequences? That's like robbing a store and complaining that the police arrested you!

Camp Kościuszko? But this base was established thanks to many years of efforts started under our governments! And the Three Seas Initiative is President Duda's initiative from 2015, which without real EU support remains just an empty slogan.

And most importantly - stop scaring with the Migration Pact! We negotiated that Poland, which has accepted 2 million refugees from Ukraine, is exempt from relocation! Zero forced immigrants - that's a lie you repeat because you have no other arguments!

True sovereignty is not stomping your foot and shouting "NO" to everything. It's wisely using our position in the EU and NATO. We brought Poland 60 billion euros, which you blocked with your arrogance. These are real funds for roads, hospitals, schools - not empty promises!

---------------

Candidate PiS: Mr. Kowalski, you are lying to my face!

There is no exemption from the Migration Pact! I read the documents - Poland has a "flexible mechanism," but that only means a choice: either we accept migrants, or we pay 20,000 euros for each unaccepted one! That's a tribute, not an exemption! And what will happen when the money for buying our way out runs out? Then Germany will start dumping their illegal immigrants on us!

You talk about 60 billion? But at what price! You had to agree to all of Brussels' demands - reinstate judges whom the Disciplinary Chamber rightly removed for misconduct! You sold the Polish judicial reform for EU money! We fought for a real reform - you reversed it!

And do you know what? Under our governments, the economy grew without that money! 5.4% GDP growth in 2022 - the best result in Europe! We proved that Poland can be strong and independent!

As for the army - you are manipulating! 164,000 plus contracts for tens of thousands of new recruits as part of voluntary basic military service! The goal of 300,000 by 2035 is realistic!

And most importantly - we never knelt before anyone! Neither before Putin, nor before Berlin, nor before Brussels! Poland is a proud nation that deserves proud leaders!

---------------

Candidate KO: Mr. Nowak, this is bordering on farce!

"20,000 euro tribute"? That's a solidarity mechanism that YOU YOURSELVES proposed in the European Council in 2020! Your Prime Minister Morawiecki signed it! And now you call it a tribute? That's hypocrisy!

And please don't mislead voters - we clearly negotiated: Poland accepted over 2 million refugees from Ukraine, we spent over 24 billion zlotys on it. The European Commission recognized this as our contribution to European solidarity. There will be no forced relocations!

"We sold judicial reform"? No, we restored the rule of law! Your pseudo-reforms were about subordinating the courts to the party. Judges of the Disciplinary Chamber punished for rulings inconsistent with the PiS line - was that your "reform"? That was an attack on the independence of the courts!

5.4% growth in 2022? Yes, after a pandemic decline! And do you know what the inflation was? Over 14%! You left us a country with the highest inflation in Europe! People couldn't make ends meet, and you boast about statistics!

And stop with this propaganda about "kneeling"! You isolated Poland for 8 years, argued with all allies. We are rebuilding Poland's position - as a respected partner, not a quarrelsome outsider. Strength is not stomping your foot, but effectiveness in pursuing Polish interests!

---------------

Candidate PiS: Mr. Kowalski, you live in a world of liberal illusions!

Inflation? And who caused it? Putin with his aggression and the Green Deal pushed by Brussels! We gave Poles an anti-inflation shield - reduced VAT on food, coal subsidies, freezing energy prices! You are eliminating all of that!

You talk about refugees from Ukraine as if it were your success? It was WE who opened the borders and hearts for Ukrainians! It was Prime Minister Morawiecki who organized aid, it was our PiS local governments across Poland that accepted refugees! And now you want to take credit for it?

"You restored the rule of law"? No! You restored judges appointed by Bierut! In Polish courts, judges who sentenced oppositionists during martial law are still ruling! We wanted to change that, and you are defending old arrangements!

And do you know what? Don't talk about effectiveness! Under our governments, Poland for the first time in history said "NO" to Germany regarding Nord Stream 2! We warned all of Europe about Putin when the West was doing business with him! Who was right? WE were!

And now the most important thing - Donald Tusk is already announcing that he will talk to everyone, even Putin "when necessary"! That is your policy - appeasement and compromises! We say clearly: you don't talk to murderers!

Poland was, is, and will be sovereign - but only under the rule of those who have the courage to defend its interests!

---------------

Candidate KO: Mr. Nowak, enough of this demagoguery!

"Judges appointed by Bierut"? That's a lie worthy of TVP propaganda from your time! The average age of a Polish judge is 45 - they were born in free Poland! Stop scaring with ghosts of the past!

Anti-inflation shield? Do you know why inflation soared? Because you printed money without backing! 700 billion zlotys spent without control! The Justice Fund for the PiS campaign, the Covid Fund for envelope elections for 70 million that didn't happen! You destroyed the state's finances!

And as for Ukraine - yes, Poles opened their hearts. But it was we, already as the government, who created systemic support - 800+ for Ukrainian children only for working parents, places in schools, medical care. You only reacted chaotically!

Nord Stream 2? Yes, you were right. But do you know what? We were against it too! That's not your merit, that's a Polish national interest that all sensible politicians support!

And most importantly - stop manipulating! Tusk said he would talk to allies about how to end the war in Ukraine. Not directly with Putin! That's the difference between diplomacy and your shouting!

The true strength of Poland is not isolation and shouting, but effectiveness. 60 billion euros for Poland - that's our effectiveness. Your foot-stomping left us only debt and inflation!

---------------

Candidate PiS: Mr. Kowalski, you have finally shown the true face of your policy!

"Partnerships are basic human rights"? No! Basic human rights are the right to life from conception, the right to raise children in accordance with one's own values, the right of a nation to self-determination! And you want to impose LGBT ideology on Poles under the guise of "human rights"!

You say "the EU is US"? Then why, when WE say NO to the migration pact, does Brussels blackmail us? Why, when WE defend Polish forests against Fit for 55, do they threaten us with penalties? Is this equality? Is this democracy?

"A modern country respected, not ridiculed"? Do you know who ridiculed us? Germany, when we were building the gas terminal in Świnoujście! France, when we warned about Putin! And who was right? POLAND was right!

And do you know what? Yes, we think in terms of independence - because it's not the 19th century, it's an ETERNAL value! Our ancestors died at Grunwald, at Vienna, in the Warsaw Uprising not so that we would now hand over sovereignty to eurocrats!

300 ships in the Vistula Spit Canal? For the first year! And the canal will serve Poland for centuries! You look at costs, we look at future generations!

Poland will either be sovereign, or it will not be at all! And Poles on October 15 will choose sovereignty!

Long live Poland!

---------------

Candidate KO: Mr. Nowak, this is truly a farce!

"LGBT ideology"? We're talking about basic human decency! When two people live together for 20 years and one dies, the other can't even get information in the hospital! That's not ideology, that's simple human suffering that we want to fix!

But let's get back to the essence of this debate. Throughout the discussion, you avoided the topic. The question was: should Poland turn to Russia for help and offer sovereignty?

Of course not! And here we agree! No one in Poland - neither us, nor you - wants to give up sovereignty to Russia! That's obvious!

But do you know what the difference between us is? We build sovereignty wisely - through alliances, through economic strength, through international respect. You build it on fear and isolation.

True sovereignty in the 21st century is not a lonely island. It's a strong position in NATO, which deters Putin. It's a voice in the EU, where we co-decide on the future of the continent. It's 60 billion euros for Polish roads, hospitals, and the army.

Your nationalism is a dead end. Poland between Germany and Russia, without allies, is a historical nightmare that we have already experienced. We offer a strong Poland, because it is wise. A Poland that does not have to choose between East and West, because it is an integral part of the West.

And Poles will choose on October 15 - fear or hope, isolation or cooperation, past or future!

---------------

Candidate PiS: Mr. Kowalski, finally we agree on the most important issue!

Yes, of course Poland should NEVER turn to Russia for help or offer it any sovereignty! There is and can be no discussion here! Putin's Russia is an aggressor and an enemy of the free world!

But you see - the difference between us is that we have been saying this clearly and firmly for years! It was we who warned against Nord Stream, it was we who built the gas terminal in Świnoujście, it was we who were the first to send tanks to Ukraine!

And as for sovereignty - yes, we need allies. That's why we strengthened the alliance with the USA, that's why we are building the Three Seas Initiative, that's why we are in NATO. But an alliance is a partnership of equals, not subordination!

You talk about 60 billion from the EU? And I talk about 200 billion zlotys for the 800+ program, which we spent from the POLISH budget! About 300 Abrams tanks and 1000 Korean K2s, which we bought with POLISH money! That is true strength!

Do you know what? On the issue of Russia, we agree - it must be isolated and defeated. On the issue of security too - Poland must be strong. We only differ in methods.

We believe that Poland can be strong through its own strength and determination. You believe that only through the grace of Brussels. And that is a fundamental difference!

But one thing is certain - under the rule of PiS or KO, Poland will remain sovereign and will NEVER bow to Russia! We agree on that!

---------------

Candidate KO: Mr. Nowak, I am glad that on the key issue we speak with one voice!

Yes, Poland will never give up sovereignty to Russia - that is the foundation on which we stand together across divisions! And you are right - on security matters, we often agree, we differ mainly in methods.

But allow me a reflection. You talk about 200 billion for 800+? We are not abolishing that! We support families! Similarly with the army - the difference is that we want to buy armaments wisely, not only from Koreans, but also develop the Polish arms industry in cooperation with European partners.

This debate showed something important - when it comes to fundamentals: independence, security, opposition to Russian aggression - Poles are united. We differ in details, in methods, sometimes in rhetoric, but the goal is common: a strong, safe, sovereign Poland.

Perhaps instead of arguing about who better defends sovereignty, we should sometimes remember that on the most important issues, we are on the same side? Because Putin certainly rejoices when Poles are divided.

I believe that Poland will be strong not thanks to anyone's grace - whether Brussels or Washington - but thanks to wise policy that uses all its assets: its own strength, alliances, and cooperation. These are not mutually exclusive options, they are elements of the same puzzle.

Long live free, sovereign Poland - regardless of who sits in the Presidential Palace!
