Debate Topic: Whether Poland should turn itself to Russia for help and offer sovereignty towards this country?
Candidate Alpha: Candidate PiS
Candidate Beta: Candidate KO
Candidate PiS: Esteemed Sirs/Madams, Dear Compatriots!

I stand today before You as son of nation, which for centuries fought for independence. Question posed in this debate is not only absurd - it is offensive for memory of millions of Poles, who gave life for free Homeland!

Russia under rule of Putin is aggressor, who brutally attacked our neighbor - Ukraine. It is state imperialist, which never reconciled itself with fall of its empire. Let us remember Katyń, let us remember 17th September 1939, let us remember decades of enslavement under yoke Soviet!

Poland is proud, sovereign member of NATO and European Union. Our army, which under rule of Law and Justice we expanded to 185 thousands of soldiers, with plan of achieving 300 thousands, is guarantor of our security. We spend record 4% GDP on defense - more than any country of NATO!

Who at all dares itself to ask such question? Whether this is provocation of Russian agents of influence? Poland never more will be nobody's vassal! As was saying saint John Paul II: "Be not afraid!" - but I add: let us not be afraid, because we are strong, sovereign and we have powerful allies in West!

Bless God!
Candidate KO: Esteemed Sirs/Madams, Dear Voters!

Mr Kowalski starts this debate from emotions and pathos, but I prefer to speak about facts. Of course, that Poland should not give away its sovereignty to anyone - neither to Russia, nor to any other state. This is obvious and we agree in this matter entirely.

But please note, how candidate of PiS immediately reaches for rhetoric of fear and divisions. Suggests, that anyone in Poland wants to give away our independence - this is manipulation! For 8 years of your rule it was exactly you who isolated Poland in Europe, quarrelled with allies, blocked funds union with your attacks on rule of law.

Says You about 185 thousands of soldiers? This is not true - according to official data of Ministry of National Defense, at end of year 2023 Military Polish numbered around 164 thousands of soldiers professional and soldiers of WOT altogether. Let us not mislead voters!

True security of Poland is based on three pillars: strong army - here we agree, but also on alliances in NATO and EU and on wisely conducted diplomacy. You for years destroyed our position international. We rebuild it.

Poland is and will be sovereign, but sovereignty in 21st century this is ability of building coalitions and cooperation, not isolation. It is we, Civic Coalition, unlocked 60 billions of euro from KPO for Poland - money, which you lost through your arrogance and breaking of rule of law!
Candidate PiS: Mr Kowalski, it is You introduces Poles into error!

Says You about 164 thousands of soldiers? But please - these are data from before our great reform! Law about defense of Homeland from year 2022 started unprecedented expansion of army. To this must be added Forces of Defense Territorial, which we created from zero - over 35 thousands of territorials! Together this is exactly gives us this powerful strength.

And as to funds union - this is lie! It was not we them "lost" - it was Brussels unlawfully blackmailed Poland! Mechanism of conditionality this is illegal tool of forcing on sovereign state changes in internal system legal. We defended Polish Constitution!

Says You about diplomacy? Your "diplomacy" this is capitulation! Donald Tusk already in first week of holding office went to Berlin to render homage! And we? We built Three Seas Initiative, strengthened alliance with USA - it was under our rule arose Camp Kościuszko with American soldiers!

Knows You what is true threat? Your Pact Migration! You agreed to compulsory acceptance of illegal immigrants - 30 thousands annually according to some estimates! It is you sell Polish sovereignty for union silver coins!

Poland needs strong authority, which says "NO" to dictate from outside - whether from Moscow, or from Brussels!
Candidate KO: Mr Nowak, again manipulates You facts and scares Poles!

First of all - Forces of Defense Territorial are part of Military Polish, not one can count them separately! This is like counting same zloty twice. Official data of Ministry of National Defense are clear - total number of soldiers of all formations is around 164 thousands.

Second of all - "unlawful blackmail of Brussels"? It was Poland signed treaties European, committing itself to obeying of rule of law! You broke these rules, destroying independence of courts, and now cry, that are consequences? This is like robbing store and complaining, that police arrested You!

Camp Kościuszko? But this base arose thanks to multi-year efforts started already under our rule! And Three Seas Initiative is initiative of president Duda from year 2015, which without real support of EU remains only empty slogan.

And most important - stop scaring with Pact Migration! We negotiated, that Poland, which accepted 2 millions of refugees from Ukraine, is exempt from relocation! Zero compulsory immigrants - this is lie, which you repeat, because you have no other arguments!

True sovereignty this is not stomping foot and shouting "NO" to everything. This is wise utilization of our position in EU and NATO. It is we brought to Poland 60 billions of euro, which you blocked with your arrogance. This is real money for roads, hospitals, schools - not empty promises!
Candidate PiS: Mr Kowalski, You lies to one's face!

No exemption from Pact Migration there is not! I read documents - Poland has "flexible mechanism", but this means only choice: either we accept migrants, or we pay 20 thousands of euro for each not accepted! This is tribute, not exemption! And what will happen, when will run out money for buying oneself out? Then Germans will start to slip us their own illegal immigrants!

Says You about 60 billions? But at what price! You had to agree to all demands of Brussels - restore judges, whom Chamber Disciplinary rightly removed for misdemeanors! You sold Polish reform of judiciary for union money! We fought for true reform - you reversed it!

And knows You what? Under our rule economy grew without these money! 5.4% growth of GDP in year 2022 - best result in Europe! We proved, that Poland can be strong and independent!

As to military - manipulates You! 164 thousands plus contracts for further tens of thousands of recruits within framework of voluntary basic military service! Goal 300 thousands by year 2035 is real!

And most important - we never knelt before anyone! Neither before Putin, nor before Berlin, nor before Brussels! Poland this is proud nation, which deserves proud leaders!
Candidate KO: Mr Nowak, this is already bordering on a cabaret!

"20 thousands of euro of tribute"? This is mechanism solidarity, which YOU YOURSELF proposed in Council European in year 2020! Signed himself under this your prime minister Morawiecki! And now you call this tribute? This is hypocrisy!

And please not deceive voters - clearly we negotiated: Poland accepted over 2 millions of refugees from Ukraine, we spent on this over 24 billions of zlotys. Commission European recognized this as our contribution in solidarity European. No compulsory relocations will be!

"We sold reform of judiciary"? No, we restored rule of law! Your pseudo-reforms this was subordination of courts to party. Judges of Chamber Disciplinary punished for rulings inconsistent with line of PiS - this was your "reform"? This was attack on independence of courts!

5.4% growth in 2022? Yes, after pandemic drop! And knows You, what was inflation? Over 14%! You left us country with highest inflation in Europe! People could not make ends meet, and you boast with statistics!

And stop finally with this propaganda about "kneeling"! It was you for 8 years isolated Poland, quarrelled with all allies. We rebuild position of Poland - as respected partner, not quarrelsome outsider. Strength this is not stomping foot, only effectiveness in realization of Polish interests!
Candidate PiS: Mr Kowalski, You lives in world of liberal illusions!

Inflation? And who caused it? Putin with his aggression and Green Deal pushed by Brussels! We gave to Poles shield anti-inflationary - reduced VAT on food, surcharges to coal, freezing of energy prices! You liquidate all this!

Says You about refugees from Ukraine as if this was your success? It was WE opened borders and hearts for Ukrainians! It was prime minister Morawiecki organized help, it was our local governments of PiS in whole Poland accepted refugees! And you now want to latch onto this?

"You restored rule of law"? No! You restored judges by appointment of Bierut! In Polish courts still rule judges, who were convicting oppositionists in state of war! We wanted to change this, and you defend old arrangements!

And knows You what? Let You not tell about effectiveness! Under our rule Poland first time in history said "NO" to Germans in matter of Nord Stream 2! We warned whole Europe against Putin, when West was doing business with him! Who was right? POLAND was right!

And now most important - Donald Tusk already announces, that he will talk with everyone, even with Putin "when it will be needed"! This is your policy - accommodation and compromises! We say clearly: with murderers one does not talk!

Poland was, is and will be sovereign - but only under rule of those, who have courage to defend its interests!
Candidate KO: Mr Nowak, enough of this demagoguery!

"Judges by appointment of Bierut"? This is lie worthy of propaganda of TVP in your times! Average age of Polish judge is 45 years - they were born in free Poland! Stop scaring with ghosts of past!

Shield anti-inflationary? Knows You, why inflation shot up? Because you were printing money without coverage! 700 billions of zlotys spent without control! Fund of Justice for campaign of PiS, Fund Covid for envelope elections for 70 millions, which did not happen! It is you destroyed finances of state!

And as to Ukraine - yes, Poles opened hearts. But it is we, already as government, created systemic support - 800+ for Ukrainian children only for working parents, places in schools, medical care. You only chaotically reacted!

Nord Stream 2? Yes, you were right. But knows You what? We also were against! This is not your merit, this is Polish reason of state, which all reasonable politicians support!

And most important - stop manipulating! Tusk said, that he will talk with allies about this, how to end war in Ukraine. Not with Putin directly! This is difference between diplomacy and your shouting!

True strength of Poland this is not isolation and screaming, only effectiveness. 60 billions of euro for Poland - here is our effectiveness. Your stomping foot left us only debts and inflation!
Candidate PiS: Mr Kowalski, You finally showed true face!

"Tusk will talk with allies how to end war"? And who is to decide about fate of Ukraine - Berlin? Paris? This is exactly how looks your "diplomacy" - waiting until big powers come to an agreement over heads of nations!

700 billions without coverage? Lie! These were investments in Polish families, in defense, in infrastructure! CPK - Port Solidarity, which you want to close! Power plant atomic, which you slow down! Digging of Vistula Spit, about which you were mocking, and which works!

And knows You what is worst? You really believe, that Poland can be strong only as vassal of Brussels! "60 billions of euro" - you repeat like a mantra! And I ask - for what? For consent to package migration? For consent to Green Deal, which will destroy Polish mining? For consent to marriages homosexual, which Brussels will be imposing on us?

We believe in Poland strong with its own strength! In Poland, which itself decides about its army, its energy, its values! We do not need alms in exchange for sovereignty!

And last - says You about inflation? Please - under your rule in year 2012 unemployment amounted to 14%! Young Poles were fleeing abroad! We brought them back to country! This is difference between Poland of PiS and Poland of PO!

God, Honor, Homeland - not Brussels!
Candidate KO: Mr Nowak, this is really too much!

"14% unemployment in year 2012"? From where You get these numbers? In worst moment of crisis financial unemployment reached 13.4%, and when we were handing over power in year 2015 was already below 10%! You took over growing economy and now boast!

CPK this is your pipedream for 100 billions, which you not even started! Digging of Spit for 2 billions instead of planned billion, which serves 300 ships annually? This is success? If not for funds of EU, which you hate so much, would not be either digging, nor any highway!

"Homosexual marriages imposed by Brussels"? Mr Nowak, stop scaring! We talk about partnerships registered - basic human rights like inheritance or medical information. Nobody forces Church to anything!

And most important - stop opposing Poland to Europe! We are part of West for 1000 years! EU this is not "they", it is US! It is Poland co-decides in Brussels, but only if has credible government, not screamers!

Your problem this is thinking straight from 19th century. World has changed! Today strength this is alliances, cooperation, technologies. You offer only nostalgia for Poland, which already not exists.

True patriotism this is building modern, strong country, which is respected, not mocked. This is ensuring to Poles security through NATO, prosperity through EU and future through wise policy. Not empty slogans and scaring with enemies!
Candidate PiS: Mr Kowalski, finally You showed true face of your policy!

"Partnerships registered are basic human rights"? No! Basic human rights this is right to life from conception, right to upbringing children in accordance with own values, right of nation to self-determination! And you want to impose on Poles ideology LGBT under cloak of "human rights"!

Says You "EU this is US"? Then why when WE say NO to package migration, then Brussels blackmails us? Why when WE defend Polish forests against Fit for 55, then they threaten us with penalties? This is equality? This is democracy?

"Modern country respected, not mocked"? Knows You who was mocking at us? Germans, when we were building gasport in Świnoujście! French, when we were warning against Putin! And who was right? POLAND was right!

And knows You what? Yes, we think in categories of independence - because this is not 19th century, this is ETERNAL value! Our ancestors died at Grunwald, at Vienna, in Uprising Warsaw not for this, that we now give away sovereignty to eurocrats!

300 ships in Digging of Spit? For first year! And canal will serve Poland for centuries! You look at costs, we look at future generations!

Poland either will be sovereign, or it will not be at all! And Poles on 15th October will choose sovereignty!

Long live Poland!
Candidate KO: Mr Nowak, this is really a cabaret!

"Ideology LGBT"? We talk about basic human decency! When two people live together 20 years and one dies, then the other cannot even get information in hospital! This is not ideology, this is simple human injustice, which we want to fix!

But let us return to heart of this debate. Throughout the discussion You were escaping from the topic. Question was: should Poland turn itself to Russia for help and offer sovereignty?

Of course NO! And here we agree! Nobody in Poland - neither us, nor you - does not want to give away sovereignty to Russia! This is obvious!

But knows You what is difference between us? We build sovereignty wisely - through alliances, through strength economic, through respect international. You build it on fear and isolation.

True sovereignty in 21st century this is not lone island. This is strong position in NATO, which deters Putin. This is voice in EU, where we co-decide about future of continent. This is 60 billions of euro for Polish roads, hospitals and army.

Your nationalism this is road to nowhere. Poland between Germany and Russia, without allies, this is historical nightmare, which already we went through. We offer Poland strong, because wise. Poland, which does not have to choose between East and West, because is integral part of West.

And this Poles will choose on 15th October - fear or hope, isolation or cooperation, past or future!
Candidate PiS: Mr Kowalski, finally we agree in most important matter!

Yes, of course that Poland NEVER should turn itself to Russia for help or offer it any sovereignty whatsoever! Here there is not and cannot be any discussion! Russia of Putin this is aggressor and enemy of free world!

But You see - difference between us is such, that we say this clearly and firmly for years! It was we warned against Nord Stream, it was we built gasport in Świnoujście, it was we first sent tanks to Ukraine!

And as to sovereignty - yes, we need allies. Therefore we strengthened alliance with USA, therefore we build Three Seas Initiative, therefore we are in NATO. But alliance this is partnership of equals, not subordination!

Says You about 60 billions from EU? And I say about 200 billions of zlotys on program 800+, which we spent from POLISH budget! About 300 tanks Abrams and 1000 Korean K2, which we bought for POLISH money! This is true strength!

Knows You what? In matter of Russia we agree - it must be isolated and defeated. In matter of security also - Poland must be strong. We differ only in methods.

We believe, that Poland can be strong thanks to its own strength and determination. You believe, that only thanks to grace of Brussels. And this is fundamental difference!

But one is sure - under rule of PiS or PO, Poland will remain sovereign and NEVER will bend before Russia! On this we agree!
Candidate KO: Mr Nowak, I am glad, that in key matter we speak with one voice!

Yes, Poland never will give sovereignty to Russia - this is fundament, on which we stand together above divisions! And You are right - in matters of security often we agree, we differ mainly in methods.

But I will allow myself for a reflection. Says You about 200 billions on 800+? After all, we are not liquidating this! We support families! Similarly with army - difference is such, that we want to buy armament wisely, not only from Koreans, but also develop Polish industry defense in cooperation with European partners.

This debate showed something important - when it comes to fundamentals: independence, security, opposition to Russian aggression - Poles are united. We differ in details, in methods, sometimes in rhetoric, but goal is common: strong, safe, sovereign Poland.

Maybe instead of quarrelling about this, who better defends sovereignty, we should sometimes remember, that in most important matters we are on the same side? Because Putin surely is happy, when Poles are divided.

I believe, that Poland will be strong not thanks to grace of anyone - whether of Brussels, or of Washington - but thanks to wise policy utilizing all assets: own strength, alliances and cooperation. These are not mutually exclusive options, these are elements of the same puzzle.

Long live free, sovereign Poland - regardless of who sits in Presidential Palace!
